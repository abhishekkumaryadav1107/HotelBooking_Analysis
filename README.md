# HotelBooking_Analysis (CAPSTONE)
To analyze the hotel booking patterns, guest preferences, and factors influencing cancellations using SQL and Excel, and to create a Power BI dashboard, you can follow these steps:

Data Exploration and Cleaning:

Import the dataset into a SQL database.
Examine the data to identify any missing values or anomalies.
Clean the data by handling missing values and ensuring consistency.
SQL Queries for Analysis:

Use SQL queries to retrieve relevant information from the tables. For example:
Identify the most popular room types.
Analyze the distribution of reservation statuses.
Calculate the average lead time for bookings.
Determine the most common meal plans chosen by guests.
Analyze the sources of bookings and the history of guests.
Excel Analysis:

Connect Excel to the SQL database or import a subset of the data.
Use pivot tables, charts, and formulas to perform deeper analysis, such as:
Trends in booking patterns over months/weeks.
Correlation between lead time and cancellations.
Revenue analysis based on meal plans and room types.
Guest composition analysis (adults, children, babies).
Power BI Dashboard Development:

Connect Power BI to the SQL database or use Excel as a data source.
Create visualizations and dashboards to represent key metrics, including:
Booking trends over time.
Cancellation rates.
Revenue by booking source, room type, and meal plan.
Guest demographics and preferences.
Source-wise analysis (Online Travel Agents, Direct Booking, etc.).
Optimization Recommendations:

Based on the analysis, provide recommendations for optimizing hotel operations, such as:
Adjusting room allocation strategies based on popular room types.
Implementing marketing strategies to attract guests from specific booking sources.
Offering promotions or incentives to reduce cancellations.
Tailoring meal plans or packages based on guest preferences.
Documentation:

Document the analysis process, findings, and recommendations for future reference.
